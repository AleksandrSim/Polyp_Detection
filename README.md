# Polyp_Detection

In this project I will detect polyps that are found during colonoscopy. I will use traditional convolutional neural networks, as well as Transfer Learning from VGG16. The dataset is very interesting and there is exciting data transformation process takes place in the first notebook (Polyp_Detection_1_Preprocessing.ipynb).
The Original dataset can be found here https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5qe9eotetjnbmq/CVC-ClinicDB.rar?dl=0&file_subpath=%2FCVC-ClinicDB. 
For deep learning part, I have used Keras framework
